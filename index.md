I am a [Bernoulli Instructor](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/bernoulli-instructors/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch). My research lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and dynamics. 

Previously, I worked as a research associate at Imperial College London. I completed my PhD in 2017 at the University of Basel and the University of Rennes 1 under the supervision of Jérémy Blanc and Serge Cantat.
