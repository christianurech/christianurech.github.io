I am a [Bernoulli Instructor](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/bernoulli-instructors/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch). My research lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and dynamics. 

Previously, I worked as a research associate at Imperial College London. I completed my PhD in 2017 at the University of Basel and the University of Rennes 1 under the supervision of Jérémy Blanc and Serge Cantat.

### Supervision and Mentorship
Don't hesitate to get in touch, if you want to do a project with me. At the intersection of algebraic geometry, group theory, and topology there are many beautiful and fun subjects on all levels. 

So far I have supervised the following projects:
- Spring 2022: Master thesis of Jeanette Fernandez about automorphisms of Aut(A^2)
- Spring 2022: Semester project of Marie Abadie about mapping class groups
- Fall 2021: 



### Circus

I thoroughly enjoy all kinds of performing arts (and I think a good math talk might very well fall into this category). I am cofounder and coorganizer of [Station Circus](https://www.stationcircus.ch) - a venue for contemporary circus performances, as well as space for creation and community.
