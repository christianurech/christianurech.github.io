I am a Senior Lecturer at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch). Before that, I worked as a [Bernoulli Instructor](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/bernoulli-instructors/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) and as a research associate at Imperial College London. I completed my [PhD](dissertation_Urech_UB_online.pdf) in 2017 at the University of Basel and the University of Rennes 1 under the supervision of [Jérémy Blanc](https://algebra.dmi.unibas.ch/blanc/) and [Serge Cantat](https://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/serge.cantat/). Here you find my [CV](https://christianurech.github.io/CV_Website_12_23.pdf). 

My research lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and dynamics. I apply tools from geometric group theory to study Cremona groups. But I am excited by everything related to groups of birational transformations or polynomial automorphisms. Recently, I have also worked on braided Thompson's groups and their finiteness properties.

### Teaching:
I enjoy teaching mathematics on all levels, be it in person or online. During the last years I got interested in evidence-based teaching strategies and I have started teaching my courses in the mode of a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) (integrating [peer instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction)). This has been received very positively by the students. 

Courses I have taught as an instructor:

Between 2010 and 2017 I worked as a teaching assistant at the University of Basel for around a dozen different courses in various fields of mathematics, which included grading homework and giving weekly tutorials.

In Summer 2018 I taught two courses at the 2018 TMD Undergraduate and Graduate Summer School at the [Nesin Math Village](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/nesin-villages/), Turkey - a wonderful place!



### Supervision and Mentorship
Do not hesitate to get in touch, if you want to do a project with me. At the intersection of algebraic geometry, group theory, and topology there are many beautiful and fun subjects on all levels. 

Supervised student projects:
- Céline Berthaud (Bachelor's project on hyperbolic groups)
- Marie Abadie, EPFL ([_Master's project_](https://christianurech.github.io/Semester_Project.pdf) on mapping class groups and Master's thesis on asymptotically rigid mapping class groups and their actions on CAT(0) cube complexes), which has lead to the following publication: [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11557)
- Jeanette Fernandez, EPFL (Master's project on Weil's regularization theorem and Master's thesis on automorphisms of Aut(A^2)), publication forthcoming
- Amandine Favre, EPFL (Bachelor's project on completions)
- Valentin Prost, EPFL (Bachelor's project on the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer theorem)
- Blerton Rashiti, EPLF (Bachelor's project on groups and graphs)
- Peter Whalley, ICL (UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity) on the Lickorish-Wallace theorem)
- JiaJie Tao, ICL (UROP on geometric group theory)
- Tom Buhl-Nielsen, ICL (UROP on the classification of compact surfaces)



### Circus

I thoroughly enjoy all kinds of performing arts (and I think a good math talk might very well fall into this category). I have cofounded and I still coorganize the following charming project in Basel: [Station Circus](https://www.stationcircus.ch) - a venue for contemporary circus performances, as well as space for creation and community.
